A puzzle game where for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction! Well.. most of the time ;)

## [Play it here!](https://sveinn-steinarsson.github.io/opposite-reaction/)

**HOW TO PLAY:** Connect the blue dots by sliding the pieces around. Note that pieces can be grouped together so when you move one, some other piece might move too. The relationship between the grouped pieces is indicated by the symbol and the color indicates which pieces are grouped together.

## About
The game is written in JavaScript and started as a project to try out the game concept. It seemed to work but instead of continuing the development by myself I decided to release it on GitHub in the hope that other people might want to contribute.

## Contributing
I encourage you to contribute to the project. There are many things which are needed, especially more levels. Please check out the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/opposite-reaction/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

**Update 2022:** Currently working on a new version. Help wanted.

## Awards
The game won first price in the RedBull and TU Graz
[Rapid Game Design Challenge](https://www.redbull.com/in-en/red-bull-mind-gamers-challenge-game-development).
